# Lec02: Image Representation and Enhancement

## Enabling Techniques

### Digitalisation

- Allows mediums to be converted to a digital format for storing on computers
- Media represented digitally as patterns of bits
- With continuously varying signals, both the _value_ and _intervals_ at which we measure can vary. If converted to digital - we restrict both to a set of discrete values
- Sampling rate: number of samples in a fixed amount of time
- Under-sampling: effects on the way reconstructed signal is perceived depends on what the signal represents, and whether it is time or space varying
    + Nyquist rate: limiting value
    + Under-sampled signal/sampled at less than Nyquist = aliasing

### Digital Data Aquisition

- Transforming illumination energy to a digital image
    + Single imaging sensor with scanning for relative displacements in x, y
    + Line sensor, provides imaging elements in one direction
    + Array sensor
- **Digitalisation steps**
    + Sampling: measure signal's value at discrete intervals
    + Quantisation: restrict value to a fixed set of intervals
    + Carried out in any order, by ADCs (analogue to digital converters)

### Visual Perception

- Mach bands: human visual system tends to undershoot or overshoot around the boundary of regions of different intensities - perceived brightness not a simple function of intensity
- Simultaneous contrast: e.g. paper looking black when looking at bright sky
- Optical illusions: eyes fill in non-existing information or wrongly perceives geometrical properties of objects
- **Application of visual perception**
    + Edge detection
    + Anti-aliasing
    + Motion blur: naturally occurs in video, must be added post computer animation for realism
    + Image compression: can remove psycho-visually redundant information without imparing quality of image perception; after reducing quality, remove false contouring to smooth

## Representing Digital Images

- Image: 3D light intensity function _f(x,y)_
    + _(x,y)_ spatial coordinates
    + _f_ is proportional to the brightness/grey-level of the image at that point
- Requires decisions about values: _M_ rows, _N_ columns, _L_ discrete gray levels allowed for each pixel _L = 2^k_
- _b_ bits to store digitalised image = _M * N * k_
- k-bit image: image with _2^k_ gray levels
- Image processing approaches fall into either
    + Spetial domain processing: direct manipulation of pixels in an image
    + Frequency domain processing techniques

## Spatial and Gray-level Resolution

- Spatial resolution
    + Sampling determines spatial resolution of an image
    + Spatial resolution: smallest discernible detail
    + _g(x,y) = T[f(x,y)]_, _T_ is operator on _f_, defined over some neighbourhood of _(x,y)_
    + Moving filter mark from point to point in an image, at each point the response of the filter is calculated using predefined relationship
    + _T_ can be linear (_T(af + bg) = a T(f) + b T(g)_) or non-linear
- Gray-level resolution
    + Smallest discernible change in gray level
    + 8 bits most common, 16 where enhancement required
- Pixel point processing
    + Simplest form of _T_, neighborhood _1x1_; _T_ becomes **gray-level transformation function** (GLT) _s = T(r)_, where _s, r_ are gray level of _f, g_
    + Computes a pixelâ€™s new value solely on the basis of its old value,without regard to any other pixe

## Image Enhancement

- Process an image so that the result is suitable than the original image for a specific application
- Image features such as boundaries, edges, and contrast, etc, are enhanced for display and analysis
- Function/parameter curves: graphs that represent and control different attributes of an image, e.g. brightness/colour
- 3 types of GLT
    + Linear: image negative
    + Logarithmic: dynamic range compression; can map a narrow range of low gray-level values in the input image into a wider range of output levels. The opposite is true of higher values of input levels => expand the values of dark pixels in an image while compressing the higher-level values
    + Power-law: contrast manipulation

### Contrast Stretching

- Piecewise-linear transformation
    + Contrast-stretching: increase the dynamic range of the gray levels, constant _m_ gray level is threshholding function that creates a binary image
    + Gray-level slicing: highlight specific range of gray levels in an image, e.g. enhancing flaws in X-ray images
- Window-level operation
    + Window is selected in the original gray level range
    + Contrast outside the window is lost, portion inside range is stretched

### Histogram Equalisation

- Histogram: image with gray levels in range _[0, L-1]_ is *h(r_k) = n_k*
    + *r_k*: kth gray level
    + *n_k*: number of pixels in image with gray level *r_k*
- Provides a view of the intensity profile of an image, often displayed as a bar chart
- Can be viewed as probability density functions
- Normalised histogram *p(r_k) = n_k * ln*
    + Divide each of values by _n_ total number of pixels
    + *p(r_k)*: estimate of probability of occurance of gray level *r_k*
- Image with pixels distributed uniformly gives appearance of high contrast
- **Histogram equalised image**: mapping to increase contrast by stretching historgram to be uniformly distributed
    + Always has pixels that reach the brightest grey level

### Noise smoothing and filtering

- **Spatial filtering**: image smoothing
    + Performed directly on the pixels of an image
    + Referred to as pixel group processing, mask processing or filtering
    + Sub-image is called a (spatial) filter, mask, kernel, template, or window
    + Values in a filter sub-image are referred to as coefficients, rather than pixels
    + **Linear spatial filtering**: response is given by a sum of products of the filter coefficients and the corresponding image pixels in the area spanned by the filter mask
- Smoothing filters for blurring and noise reduction
- **Linear filter**: averaging filters
    + e.g. box, weighted filter
    + Output is average of pixels contained in neighborhood of filter mark
- **Non-linear filter**: order-statistics filters
    + e.g. median, max, min filter
    + Response is based on ordering (ranking) the pixels contained in the image area encompassed by the filter, and then replacing the value of the center pixel with the value determined by the ranking result
    + Median: sort values of the pixel and its neighbors, determine their median, and assign this value to that pixel - good for noise
