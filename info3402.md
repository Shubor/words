# Lec01: Introduction to Project Management

- Project: temporary endeavor to create a unique product/service/result
- Program: group of related projects managed in a coordinated way
- Project stages
	- Intiation: define project objectives and scope
	- Implementation: execute workplan
	- Termination
- Project portfolio management
	- Working on right projects? Investing in right areas? Have the right resources to be competitive?
	- Organising and managing projects and programs as a portfolio of investments
- Project management
	- Carrying out projects well? Projects on time/budget? Do project stakeholders know what they should be doing?
	- Application of knowledge/skills/tools/techniques to project activities to meet project requirements

### Project Failure Rates and Common Problems

- Causes of failure
	- Missing focus: unclear objective, lack of business focus
	- Content issues: shifting requirements, technical complexity
	- Skill issues
	- Execution issues
- Common problems
	- Poor communication, therefore lack of vision and direction
	- Insufficient resources planning
	- Unrealistic schedules
	- Poor project requirements
	- NB: these are the 4 key activities central to project management

### Project Performance

- The number of successful projects has increased in the past decade, reasons for this improvement in performance are:
	- Average cost of project halved
	- Better management tools to monitor and control progress
	- Better skilled project managers
	- Better project management processes
- What helps project succeed?
	1. User involvement
	2. Executive support
	3. Clear business objectives
	4. Emotional maturity
	5. Optimising scope
	6. Agile process
	7. Project management expertise
	8. Skilled resources
	9. Execution
	10. Tools and infrastructure
- Tools and Techniques for management
	- Project charter
	- Scope statement
	- Work breakdown structure (scope)
	- Gantt charts, network diagrams, critical path analysis, critical chain scheduling (time)
	- Cost estimates and earned value management (cost)

# Lec02: Project Management Process Frameworks

### Project Management Frameworks, Standards, Methodologies

#### PMBOK vs Prince2

- **PMBOK**
    + Started with IT projects
    + Standard: descriptive
    + Focus on PM's role
    + Describes core practices and a wider range of techniques that can be applied to manage projects
- **Prince2**: process driven project management
    + Started with business
    + Methodology: prescriptive
    + Defines the roles
    + A series of management processes defining what must be done, when and how it must be done and by whomever in the life of a project

#### Project Lifecycle

- PMBOK: initiating -> planning -> executing -> monitoring -> controlling -> closing
- Prince2: starting up -> initiating -> planning -> directing -> controlling a stage -> managing product delivery -> managing stage boundaries -> closing
- Traditional project lifecycle: concept -> development -> implementation -> close

#### Product Lifecycle : SDLC

- SDLC: framework for describing the phases involved in developing and maintaining information systems
- **Systems development projects** can follow:
    + Predictive lifecycle: scope of the project can be clearly articulated and the schedule and cost can be predicted
    + Adaptive software development (ASD) lifecycle: requirements can't be clearly expressed, projects are mission driven and component based, using time-based cycles to meet target dates
- **Predictive lifecycle models**: waterfall, spiral, incremental build, prototyping, Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- **Adaptive lifecycle models**
    + Assumes requirements can't be clearly defined
    + Speculate - collaborate - learn

### Project Management Process

#### Project Initiation: How to Develop/Choose Project

- Process: series of actions directed toward a result
- Project management can be viewed as a number of interlinked processes
    + Process groups include initating, planning, executing, monitoring and closing and closing
- **SWOT analysis**: purpose
    + Considers strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
    + Helps determine potential problems
- **SMART objectives**
    + Specific: not open to interpretation
    + Measurable
    + Agreed
    + Realistic: shouldn't require super-human effort
    + Time-bound: agreed upon time frame
- Scope: to define, you must work out what is in/out of scope
- Deliverables: a unique, tangible item that supports project objectives and can be a product/process/report/event
- Selecting projects
    + Focus on broad organisational needs
    + Categoriation of projects (e.g. time, duration, priority, criticality)
    + Financial analysis (e.g. net present value, payback analysis)
    + Weighted scoring model
    + Balanced scorecard

#### Creating the Project Team

- Stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, performing
- Team building activities: physical challenges, psychological preference indicator tools
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): tool for determining personality preferences and helping team mates understand each other

**Organising key activities for project team**

- Identify project team requirements
    + Determine roles and responsibilities, find resources to fill roles
- Assign team members to work plan  tasks
    + Communicate responsibilities, target dates, deliverables
    + Resource planning
- Orient team members to project
- Train team members
    + Project specific knowledge/skill standards/procedures

# Lec03: Project Integration Management

-  Project integration management involves coordinating all of the other knowledge areas throughout a project’s life cycle
- Main processes include:
    1. **Initating**: develop the project charter
    2. **Planning**: develop the project management plan
    3. **Executing**: direct and manage project execution
    4. **Monitoring and controlling**: monitor and control project work, perform integrated change control
    5. **Closing**: Close the project or phase

### Initating Processes

- Check business case and clarify key drivers
- Stakeholder engagement
- Clarify requirements and expectations
- _Output_: business case, project charter, scope statement
- **Project Charter**
    - Describes business needs (product objectives, business benefits, product description)
    - Identifies project sponsor and manager
    - Project proposal goes into the project charter
    - Inputs for developing a charter: project statement of work, business case, agreements, enterprise environmental factors, organisational process assets

### Planning Processes

- _Output_: project management plan (PMP) for success
- Several iterations, estimates for project scope with clear assumptions
- Roles and responsibilities
- Risk and risk mitigation
- **PMP**
    + Introduction or overview of the project (Title, Purpose, Background and Strategic Context, Priority, Other Related Projects, Objectives, Scope, Deliverables, Assumptions)
    + Description of how the project is organized (Project Client/ Owner, Project Sponsor, Project Manager, Manager of project Manager, Project Team Members, Steering Committee/ Working party, Key Stakeholders)
    + Management and technical processes used on the project
    + Work to be done, schedule, and budget information (Schedule, Resource and Cost Plan, Project Risk Assessment, Quality Management Plan, Communications and Reporting, Controls)

### Executing Processes

- Resource allocation
- Clarify deliverables, roles, accountability
- Use project plan
- Regualar communication (internal and external)
- Manage vendors/suppliers
- _Output_: progress/status reports, meeting minutes
- **Progress report**
    + Project Name
    + Team Member
    + Date
    + What has been achieved this week
    + Work for next week
    + What is going well/badly (why)
    + Issues/suggestions/changes

### Monitoring and Controlling Processes

- Manage scope changes
- Look after needs of team members
- Monitor activities of vendors/suppliers
- Report on project progress each week (scope, quality, effort, risk, schedule, cost)
- _Output_: change request form, change reports, updated scope definition
- Changes are often beneficial and project team should plan for them
- **Change control system**
    + Formal, documented process that describes when/how official project documents and work may be changed
    + Describes who is authorised to make changes, and how to make them
    + Change control board (CCB) group of people responsible for approving/rejecting project changes

### Closing Processes

- Complete all outstanding items
- Document reason for closer (completion, lack of benefits, change in circumstances etc.)
- Capture lessons learned
- Manage transition
- _Output_: final project report

## Death Marches, Black Swans, Runaway Systems

- Black swan: likelihood of failure > 50%
- Project escalation: constantly adding resources to a project
- Death Marches and Black Swans can be avoided if the Business Case is thoroughly developed, interrogated and tested and Project Performance is well planned, managed and monitored – including closure of projects if the project has escalated without evidence that cost-benefits stack up

## Financial Analysis

- Financial analysis of projects to determine cost-benefit
    + Net present value (NPV)
    + Return on investment (ROI)
    + Payback/breakeven analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis: identifying and estimating all costs and benefits
    + Costs: development, set-up, operational
    + Benefits: direct, assessable indirect, intangible

### NPV

- Time value of money
    + Money now can be invested
    + Money in the future is less certain, can suffer from inflation
    + Need common base value for money
- Use **discount rate** to determine prevent value of cash outlays and receipts
    - _Discount rate_: rate of return used to calculate the present value of future cash flows
    - _Present value_: current value of a future cash flow

### ROI

- _ROI = (total discounted benefits - total discounted costs) / discounted costs_
- Always a %, the higher the better
- **IRR** internal rate of return
    + Discount rate that makes _NPV = 0_ at the conclusion of a project

### Payback Analysis

- Payback period: amount of time it will take to recoup (in form of net cash inflows), the total follars invested in a project
- Payback: _net cumulative discounted benefits = costs_

### Weighted Scoring Model

- Tool that provides systematic process for selecting projects based on criteria
    1. Identify important criteria
    2. Assign weights to each criterion
    3. Assign scores to each criterion
    4. Multiply scores by weights; get total weighted scores
- Higher score is better
