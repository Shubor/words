# Lec02: Introducing C++

### Hello, World

- `#include <iostream>`: handle streaming in and out
- `namespace`: keep names of things organised
- `count`: console output
- `<<`: 'streams' the string to `cout`
- default values of each field aren't zero, must always initialise

### C++

- Defines minimal range and size of types
- Single and multiple inheritance of classes
- Can't have `void*` assigned without casting
- Functions with no arguments use `foo()`
- `new` and `delete` instead of `malloc` and `free`

### Files

- Header: class declaration .h
- Source: implementation, function definitions .cc/.cpp/.cp
- Methods in headers
	- Pro: compilers can expand them in place where theyâ€™re called for performance optimisation (e.g. inline)
	- Con: if you have another implementation for the prototypes (declarations) in the header you may need to change the implementation

### Classes

- Classes = public, can have functions
- Structs = private
- Can include headers more than once
	- Shouldn't; you can't declare a variable/class/struct more than once
	- `#ifndef MyClass_H_`, `#define MyClass_H_`, `#endif MyClass_H_` (ignores namespaces)

### Namespaces

- Abstract space in which you can keep names, so that within the space you don't have conflicting names
- Namespace declaration
	- `namespace foo { string bar() { return "hi"; } }`
	- `void greet() { std::cout << foo::bar() << std::endl; }`
- Set of names available is the union of all namespaces
- Can be nested

# Lec03: Pointers and Classes

### Pointers

- Allows you to change object passed
- Less information: object may be huge, but it's address is small
- Operate on pointed-to object, by passing it a pointer `*x`

### Constructors/Destructors

- Allows us to make instances of classes
- Can have multiple constructors, whose use at runtime is determined by the set of arguments supplied
- **Default arguments**_
    - e.g. `Ball(double r = 1.41, int col = 0x080808) { radius = r; RGB = col; }`
- Not permitted to have two constructors that could both be called under some circumstances
- **Initialiser list**: a set of initialisation commands for fields in the class, that are carried out before the body of the constructor
    - e.g. : `a(2), b(a), c(3)`
- **Constructors with inheritance**
    - `class Rectangle : public Square` Rectangle calls Square constructor in the initialiser list
- `new`
    - Constructors are called without `new`
    - Must use pointer when using `new` to create a new object `Ball *black = new Ball()`
- `delete` destructor, deallocates memory allocated in the constructor
    - `delete[]` for arrays
    - `delete` for objects
    - Automatic removal of values in instances of classes
- `virtual`: method/destructor can be overridden in a derived class
    - Pure virtual: Mark methods that must be overriden with `= 0` in the base class definition
- **Destructor** for `class MyClass` is `~MyClass()`
    - Destructors often marked `virtual`: ensures it is called when the destructor of the derived class is called; if left off, the behaviour when destroying the derived class is undefined

```c++
#include "BagOfNumbers.h"

BagOfNumbers::BagOfNumbers(int size) { numbers = new int[size]; }
BagOfNumbers::~BagOfNumbers() { delete [] numbers; }

int main() {
    BagOfNumbers bon(5);
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        BagOfNumbers *bonPtr = new BagOfNumbers(100000);
        delete bonPtr;
} }
```

### Inheritance

- `public` inheritance: members of the base class retain their access levels
- `protected` inheritance: members of base class restricted to at most protected
- `private` inheritance: members of the derived class only privately accessable
- Can't grant more access, only _restrict_

### Resource Acquisition is Initialisation (RAII)

- RAII design means that data objects are correctly destroyed
- e.g. File access; as C++ guarantees to call destructors of variables as it unrolls the stack from an exception, file access will be unlocked correctly

# Lec04: References and Constants

### Reference

- Reference to an object enables access to the referred-to object without having to dereference (alias to the object)
    + `int n; int &refN = n;`
- Use references exactly as though they are the objects themselves
- Can dereferences a pointer, but not dereference a reference
- Operating on a reference, operates on the object

```c++
int &z = x;
z++; // increments x, not z
```

### Memory

- Static: code, constant values, static methods/variables
- Heap: dynamically created variables/objects
- Stack: local (automatic) variables

```c++
int charSize;                         // BSS (block started by symbol)
char* makeACharPtr() {
    char* chPtr;                      // stack
    charSize = sizeof(char);          // data
    chPtr = (char*) malloc(charSize); // heap
    return chPtr;
}
```

- Although java has garbage collection, there is a performance penalty
    + For Node x <=> Node y, which refer to nothing else, garbage collection would see this and not destroy them - checking that this set of objects isn't referenced outside itself takes time
- Passing object to a method `void foo(Messager m)`
    + Costly, so a local copy is made of the value passed
    + Problem: for complex objects, copies could be made that don't carry over some subtle structure - needs a deep copy
- Shallow copies duplicate values, but not necessarily corresponding links
- Passing object by reference `void foo(Messager &m)`
    + No local copy made, no excessive use of stack memory
    + Local variable is accessed the same way as if it were a plain object

### `const`

- Passing by reference: safety
    + `const` reference: object referenced can only be observed and not changed
    + `void foo(const int &n)`
- `const` and non-`const` are _different types_, so you can have 2 method profiles that only differ in the `const`-ness of their arguments
    + `void foo(const int &n)` and `void foo(int &n)`
- `const` variable: once initialised it couldn't be changed
- Non-`const` variable can be passed to a method that accepts `const` type
- `const` variable can't be passed to a method that accepts non-`const` types
- `const` method: can be in a class, but not in a non-member function
    + Having `const` for a method function (function in a class) is convenient

### `mutable`

- `mutable` for variables that are permitted to change, but don't change anything 'crucial' to the object
- Used for variables that store meta-information, to save having to calculate it many times unnecessarily

# Lec05: Inheritance in C++

### Inheritance

- Inheriting abstract class: if there are abstract (pure virtual) methods in class, it is abstract, can't be instantiated because it is not complete
- Interfaces: abstract classes in which everything is marked pure virtual
    + Everything has to be implemented in a derived class
    + Need to use multiple inheritance to make a derived class implement the methods in the pure abstract class
- Dreaded diamond: baseClass -> 2 subClasses -> hybridClass
    + Possibility data in the base class is inherited twice
    + Avoid with virtual inheritance
    + Mark the 2 subClasses that could be multiply inherited with keyboard `virtual`, i.e. `class subOne : public virtual baseClass { };`

### Early and Late Binding

- Early binding: at compile time a lookup table is created for symbols encountered so they can be found during executions
- Late/dynamic binding: dynamic type of an object determines which member function will be executed at runtime
    + At compile, a virtual table (vtable) is constructed for each class in order for late binding to work
- **vtable** contains pointers to the _most derived function_ that can be called on objects of the class
    + Each class has it's own vtable
    + Each time a base class instance is made, a hidden pointer is added that points to this vtable
    + Derived classes inherit this hidden pointer, but point to the vtable for the derived class

### Copy Constructor

- Constructor that takes an object as a source and uses it to make a copy
- e.g. `MyClass( MyClass &other);`
- Don't need to write one, get one by default, but it is a _shallow_ copy
